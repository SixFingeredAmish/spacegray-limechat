[Spacegray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/)  theme for [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/).

Some changes from [tkstnmr’s original](https://github.com/tkstnmr/spacegrayish-limechat):
- Uses Apple’s San Francisco Mono
- Added some breathing room to the body
- Fixed inactive server names being invisible

## Instructions

Installing the theme
```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/net.limechat.LimeChat-AppStore/Themes/
git clone https://github.com/SixFingeredAmish/spacegrayish-limechat.git
ln -s spacegrayish-limechat/Spacegrayish.* .
```
The theme should be available in the app preferences.

(Optional) Installing the font

San Francisco Mono is already on your Mac, just not enabled for apps other than Terminal. You will need to install it.

- Install each font file, by clicking on each file and then clicking Install.
